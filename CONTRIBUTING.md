- Bug fixes: `fix/bug-name`
- Documentation: `docs/topic`
- Performance improvements: `perf/improvement-name`

### Commit Message Guidelines

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests

Example:
```
feat(dashboard): add new quality metrics visualization

- Add bar chart component
- Implement data transformation
- Add unit tests

Closes #123
```

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript Guidelines
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Define interfaces for all component props
- Use type inference where possible
- Avoid using `any` type
- Use proper type guards

Example:
```typescript
interface QualityMetricProps {
  score: number;
  label: string;
  trend: 'up' | 'down' | 'stable';
}

const QualityMetric: React.FC<QualityMetricProps> = ({ score, label, trend }) => {
  // Component implementation
};
```

### React Best Practices
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Follow the single responsibility principle
- Use proper prop types and default props
- Implement proper loading states

### Styling Guidelines
- Use Material-UI components when possible
- Follow the project's theme configuration
- Use styled-components for custom styling
- Maintain consistent spacing and layout

## Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests
- Write tests for all new components
- Use Jest and React Testing Library
- Maintain minimum 80% code coverage
- Test both success and error cases

Example:
```typescript
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import QualityMetric from './QualityMetric';

describe('QualityMetric', () => {
  it('renders with correct score', () => {
    render(<QualityMetric score={85} label="Quality" trend="up" />);
    expect(screen.getByText('85')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

### Integration Tests
- Test component interactions
- Test data flow
- Test error handling
- Test loading states

### E2E Tests
- Test critical user flows
- Test responsive design
- Test accessibility

## Documentation

### Code Documentation
- Document complex functions and components
- Use JSDoc comments
- Keep documentation up to date
- Document any assumptions or limitations

Example:
```typescript
/**
 * Calculates the quality score based on various metrics
 * @param {QualityMetrics} metrics - The quality metrics object
 * @returns {number} The calculated quality score
 * @throws {Error} If metrics are invalid
 */
const calculateQualityScore = (metrics: QualityMetrics): number => {
  // Implementation
};
```

### Component Documentation
- Document component props
- Provide usage examples
- Document any side effects
- Document accessibility considerations
